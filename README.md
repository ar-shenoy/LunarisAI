# ðŸŒ™ LunarisAI

**LunarisAI** is a personalized period prediction assistant powered by Machine Learning.  
It estimates the next menstrual cycle start date using user health and cycle inputs with uncertainty awareness.  
Built with **Random Forest Regression**, and deployed via **Streamlit**, LunarisAI adapts predictions based on factors like PCOS, stress, and birth control usage.

## Features

-  **ML Model**: RandomForestRegressor with preprocessing pipeline
-  **Predicts**: Number of days until next period + predicted calendar date
-  **Uncertainty Window**: Adjusts based on cycle regularity, PCOS, stress, etc.
-  **Web App**: Streamlit interface with full prediction and feedback loop
-  **Explainability**: SHAP beeswarm plots for feature impact visualization
-  **Smart Alerts**: Flags post-menopausal inconsistencies, high-stress cases, abnormal outputs

##   Data & Ethics

 >  *LunarisAI is trained on synthetic data and does not store any user inputs.*


- The dataset is synthetically generated using ChatGPT, While building Lunaris I've added noise and variability to simulate real-world menstrual cycle patterns.
- This is not a clinical tool. For real concerns, consult a gynecologist.
- No personal data is logged or saved.
- Predictions are made locally per session.
